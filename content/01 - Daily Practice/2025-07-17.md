## Writing and Study
**Scriptural Reading:** 30-Day Gospel Challenge.
- Matthew 12-14

**Focus Project Today:**  
- Learn about and get branding images on RaD site.

**Notes:**
- Published [[The importance of the Tridentine Mass, and the dangers of partisanship]].
- Started working on the [[St. Clare of Assisi]] note.
- Sat in Adoration for 45 minutes after work.  I experienced a weird bout of physical anxiety when I entered the chapel.  I expected to have the place to myself (for some reason), but there were several others there.  I had not intended to read, but did take a book with me.  I ended up reading for about 2/3s of the time, and spending the rest in quiet contemplation.  It was a weird little snap of anxiety, I'm not really sure what that was about.  It was similar to the feelings I get before public speaking, but obviously I wasn't doing that at Adoration.  At least I know where the Adoration chapel is now, and broke the seal (as it were).  I'll mention this to my spiritual director and see if I can get some feedback.
