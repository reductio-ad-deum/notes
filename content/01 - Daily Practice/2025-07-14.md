## Log:
- Set up Quartz to publish these notes to the web via Github.  Took quite a bit of tinkering, but I'm please with the first stab at it.  I would like to go back and adjust the look of the site, so more pleasant coloring, images/branding, etc.  I'm not totally thrilled with the workflow at the moment, it's quite a bit more involved than using Obsidian Publish, natively.  But I'm not too keen on this project costing $8/month in perpetuity.  I am considering a custom domain name, though.  
- I found an absolutely beautiful rendition of the [Angelus in Latin, sung.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDC-g5osZWA) Definitely worth saving/bookmarking.
