## Writing and Study
### Lectio Divina
**Scripture Passage:**  
- [[Lectio - Genesis 18.1-10a]] re-reading to prepare for Sunday Mass.

**Scriptural Reading:** 30-Day Gospel Challenge.
- Matthew 15-18 

**Focus Project Today:**  
- Try to get the site logo working properly, and preferably figure out how to suppress the title on the home page after Quartz processes the markdown files.
	- Got the logo and favicon working.  Looks pretty good, but maybe some slight spacing tweaks are needed.  Still can't figure out the title thing, tried custom css, but no joy.  

**Notes:**
- Worked a bit on the [[The Desert a City]] note.  I think they MO will be to keep updating this note as I read, and then at the end of the work do a final edit.  I think that will be more fruitful than a single, monolithic writing at the end.
