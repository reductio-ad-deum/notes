## Notes
**Website work:**
- Got Google Analytics to work with Quartz, more straightforward, actually, than having to copy the analytics code to every tracked page.  The Quartz component only needs added once in the config file, then when it passes through the html generation stage, it gets reproduced appropriately on every page.  These little canned components that can be use, moved, and edited are really useful for projects like this.
