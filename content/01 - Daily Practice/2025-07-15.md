## Prayer
**Morning Prayer:**
> - [[Angelus]]

**Afternoon Prayer:**
> - Angelus
> - [[Rosary - How to Pray|The Sorrowful Mysteries]]

**Evening Prayer:**
> - Angelus
> - [[Our Father]]
> - Extemporaneous personal prayer

**Reflection:**
- I really quite like the idea of praying the Angelus three times a day.  I've been trying to do that roughly at the 6am, noon, and 6pm time frames, plus or minus some number of minutes.  I quite like the [sung version in Latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDC-g5osZWA) that I recently found.
