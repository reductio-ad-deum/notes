# Welcome to my **_Hypomnemata_**
----

This site is a place where I collect, explore, and share my journey in faith, prayer, and study.  
Here you’ll find reflections on Scripture, notes on spiritual reading, personal journals, and resources I’ve gathered along the way.

## ✨ Start Here
You can view my notes using the navigation pane on the left.  It's broken down into topics, some of which have tables or maps of content, others which are more zettlekasten style.
