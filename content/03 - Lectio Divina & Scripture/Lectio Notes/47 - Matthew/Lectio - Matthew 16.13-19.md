# Lectio Divina – Matthew 16:13-19

---
## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  Son of Man is an interesting phrase that I don't really know much about.
	- ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου.
	- Need to check out [[Daniel 7.13]]
- Peter's Confession and Commissioning.

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  Interesting that NABRE uses "Church" and NJB uses "Community."
	- ἐκκλησίαν, in the Greek "assembly, community, church." Related to the English ecclesiastic, clearly.

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
-  "And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,"
	- Peter (Πέτρος) and rock (πέτρᾳ)
	- I wonder if that wordplay exists in Aramaic or if that was just for Greek-speaking audience?
		- Turns out, it does.  Kepha (כֵּיפָא), meaning rock, is the same for the name and substance/item.  Interesting.  Also, maintained in [[John 1.42]] "You shall be called Cephas."  Cursory reading suggests it was not a given name prior to this early Christina use.

**Observations about the text (literal meaning, characters, structure, etc.):**  
Receiving the Keys of the Kingdom is such a powerful image.  In re-reading these passages after a long time away, the preparation Jesus undertakes to organize and bolster his students is much more apparent to me, now.

The Papacy is one of the most difficult parts of Catholicism for other Christians.  The objections range from reasonable (_primus inter pares_) to bigoted.  Modernly, we give "the key to the city" to some favored resident or VIP, and while that is poignant presentation, it lacks the import of the Keys of the Kingdom.

In doing some side-reading, I was directed back to the Old Testament.  "I will place the key of the House of David on his shoulder; what he opens, no one will shut, what he shuts, no one will open." [[Isaiah 22.22]] In Isaiah, Eliakim is given the "key of the house of David," and what he opens will be open, and closes will be closed.  The parallel between that text and the present is clear.  Here, The Son of David gives the Keys of the Kingdom, and orders that what Simon-Peter binds and looses on earth will be held as such in heaven.

This given strictly to Peter.  I see some arguments that the Commissioning was for all of the Apostles at this time, but the text has Jesus saying "thee" or singular-you in the Greek (σοι).  So that reading seems unlikely. This, coupled with the rock-bit do seem to be giving Peter a unique, singular position.  There are other, seemingly related passages that do expand a similar authority to the other Disciples ([[Matthew 18.18]]), and institute the forgiveness of sins ([[John 20.23]]), but it's not clear that this is the exact same as what's laid on Peter, here.

It's interesting to see the divine authority of Jesus being invested in the earthly foundation he is laying.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
-  It is a great comfort to know that one's soul is in the same state of grace after Confession as at the moment of one's Baptism.  That grace, however, is checked by the awareness that need for it lies squarely on us.  Our tendency and actions/omissions which injure our relationship to God are our responsibility.  One must be extremely vigilant to avoid the "oh well, I'll just go to Confession," slippery slope when addressing the sin in our hearts.

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer (thanksgiving, intercession, sorrow, praise, etc.):**  
-  Lord, thank you for providing us with your Church in your absence.  We are grateful full to have the Keys to the Kingdom here on Earth, that open the pathway to your everlasting divine love and presence.  Thank you for knowing that we would need guideposts, guides, and directions in the journey back into your presence in the world to come.  Amen.

## 4. *Contemplatio* – Contemplation  
_Rest in God's presence._  

**Time in silence:**  

---
## Closing Prayer  
- Lord, thank your for this time with your Word.  Allow understanding to enter our minds and hearts, and change those minds and hearts that we may better emulate your Son, Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.
