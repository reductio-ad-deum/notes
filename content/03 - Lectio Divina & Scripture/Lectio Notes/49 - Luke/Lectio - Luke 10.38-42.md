# Lectio Divina – Luke 10.38-42

---
## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  The story of Mary and Martha
- Martha is burdened with serving.

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  Here, Martha is distracted with serving.  Those are two fairly different views on the situation.  NABRE feels more neutral or sympathetic to Martha, where as NJB makes it seem almost a personal failing.  

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
-  "burdened with much serving"
	- NABRE: burdened
	- NJB: distracted
	- Greek:  περιεσπᾶτο, from περί and σπάω; to drag all around, i.e. (figuratively) to distract (with care) [Strong.]  Also, to draw off, or to strip bare.  Interesting visual of the effects of anxiety, there.
- ... and it is not to be taken from her.

**Observations about the text:**  
This was always an interesting story to me.  I sympathized with Martha, who is doing her best to be a good host.  She's got a lot of pressure in hosting these guests.  We have similar cultural expectations today, but I'm guessing those were more pressing in her place and time.  At a cursory reading, Mary seems to be shirking a duty.  In fact, she's attending a more serious duty.  Martha is caught up in the appearance of things, and Mary is attending to what's actually urgent.

I am a person who often is tied up in the logistics.  I like to plan, have things laid out, and a clear goals.  Are all the materials and tools at hand?  Have we talked through the steps a couple of times?  Have we discussed possible hiccoughs?  Okay, then we can begin.

My wife is very different.  She prepares what's needed right now, and gets started.  She may have to circle around a few times, restart, get help, or otherwise make accommodations.  But she's working.

The net effect of these different dynamics is she starts more things than I do.  I'm not sure that one is *per force* better than the other, both are at time advantageous, and other times disadvantageous.  We often have difficulty communicating about projects, because we think of them so differently.  It's a weird outlier, actually.  Because in basically every other realm we communicate very well.

I need to talk though each step to make sure we have a shared understanding.  She can work silent next to someone, and just fill in.  Intuiting the next steps.  Radically different processes.

I see myself in Martha, here.  Concerned for the logistics.  Making sure all the people and things are in the right space.  Often beset by anxiety and stress.  I see my wife in Mary, attending to what's important, intuiting what's next, and *doing* the right thing.  This may be an oversimplification, in some instances these roles are reversed, of course.  But the important thing here is to note Jesus' clarification on what the real work is, and how to do it.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
-  In which aspects of my life am I hustling about with logistics, when I should be listening?
- In my prayer life, am I speaking more than listening?
- How can I remember to focus on what's important, what's right in front of me as a part of God's plan?

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer:**  
-  Lord, help us to attend to that which merits attention.  Open our hearts that we may listen to Your word, and thereby learn what you want for us.  Protect us from the anxieties of everyday life, and to focus on that which is truly meaningful, Your plan for us.  Deliver us from the burdens of society, and let us take time to sit in Your presence.  We ask this through the name of You Son, Christ the Lord.

## 4. *Contemplatio* – Contemplation  
_Rest in God's presence._  

**Time in silence:**  

---
## Extra: *Actio* – Action  
_Discern a step to live out the passage._  
**What action am I being called to take today?**

-  I still have not gone to sit in Adoration since the last time ([[Lectio - Luke 10.1-12, 17-20|*actio* re: adoration]]) I discussed that in these notes.  But I have found a place and time where I can, and gotten directions.  I should be able to go Wednesday, this week.  That's my action step.
