# Lectio Divina – Luke 11:1-3

## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  Introduction of the [[Our Father]] prayer.
- "because of his persistence" is a funny way of drawing to mind our ... nagging? God with our needs.
- Knock and the door will be opened.

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  A call to fathers, to be mindful of that relationship and see how our relationship with God the Father must necessarily be a higher and better version.

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
-  If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

**Observations about the text:**  
"Our Father, who art in heaven," begins this passage, calling to mind that God the Almighty is our heavenly father.  The Gospel Writer then asks for those who are (earthly) fathers, even though they have fallen nature, still (often) do the best they can for their children.  At best, not to harm them as in the stone, serpent, scorpion portion.  But usually to support flourishing as well.  How generous are good fathers with their children?  How much do they provide, sacrifice, and do?  

"How much more..." asks us, then, to reorient to the all-knowing and all-powerful nature of our heavenly father, and how he was provided us with what we need, opportunities for growth, challenges to overcome, and people to love.  It's a superlative sort of fatherly love, and we should rest in comfort with that.

I, myself, am preparing to be a father, and the slew of things that need to be fixed, made right, and prepared to fulfill that role are at times daunting.  It's a major change, and it has a ... gravity to it, pulling at all things near and far towards that end.  Other major plans are being recalculated, flaws in myself that I used to be able to ignore or set aside demand correction.  All this for fatherhood.

What mountains might God have moved to give us our lot?  What roads made straight (or windy) as we might need?  What love must He have for us?

Should we not meet that with trust and humility?  I think so.
I'm trying.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
-  Those of us whose religious formations occurred as children view God the Father in light colored by our own fathers and grandfathers, or other male role models.  It's format that works for quite a long while, however when fatherhood approaches, that perspective also does.  It shifts from being our being the recipient of paternal care to what it is like to give paternal care.  It requires a reframing of the divine. It also requires a reframing of the sacrifice of a Son.  It's no longer intellectual, I can feel it in my gut even at the thought of such a thing.

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer:**  
-  Lord, who so loved the world that you gave your only begotten Son that we might be saved, teach us the meaning of such a paternal love.  Instill in our hearts the breadth of that love, that we may share it with others, as it has so abundantly been shared with us.  No matter what our families may look like, bless and keep them, and set them on the paths which follow your will.  We ask this, in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ.  Amen.

## 4. *Contemplatio* – Contemplation
