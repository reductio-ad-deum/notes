# Lectio Divina – Luke 5:1-11
---
## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  Lake of Gennesaret is also the Sea of Galilee.
- The "Fishers of Men" story.
- Simon Peter's call.

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  Put out into deep water

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
-  Put out into deep water.

**Observations about the text:**  
As a child, this story sort of confused me.  Simon Peter and his compatriots need for fish seems like such a small thing to merit a miracle.  But don't all of the trials, tribulations, difficulties, joys, and success of others often feel small?

Of course God knows our burdens, and in his mercy meets us where we are.  Simon Peter needed not just a miracle, but this one.  It seems some small thing, that one catch should be underwhelming.  But it is precisely the right spot to place the lever to move his heart.  

When we experience God in those little moments, those too are a miracle.  And they may not seem so to others, but when they move our hearts they are surely something special.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
- What small things in my life are the fish of other people's?  
- Do I remain open to see the workings of God, or rely too much on what I think the opinions of others might be?
- Would I be embarrassed to tell my fish-story?  Was Simon Peter?

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer:**  
-  Lord, thank you in great goodness for knowing the small things that move our hearts.  Thank you for the miracle of your Son, and for the gifts of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  Prepare our hearts to perceive and receive those moments of your grace, and keep us ever vigilant for the effects of your love in our lives.
