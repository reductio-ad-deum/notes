# Lectio Divina – Genesis 19:15-29

---
## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  That is why the town is called Zoar. Why is that?
	- Zoar/Segor apparently means "small" or "insignificant."
- But Lot's wife looked back, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.
	- [[Lectio - Luke 17.32|Luke 17:32]]

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  Thus it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he did not forget Abraham and he rescued Lot from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities where Lot was living.

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
- pillar of salt
- did not forget
- rescued

**Observations about the text:**  
One of the difficulties many modern readers—including myself—have is reconciling the God of the New Testament, characterized by love, forgiveness, and mercy, with the God of the Old Testament, who often appears as an agent of vengeance, punishment, and destruction. _Genesis 19_ is a stark example: it records both the destruction of the cities of the plain and the fate of Lot’s wife.

In this chapter, Sodom and Gomorrah are guilty of grave sins: pride, greed, injustice, neglect of the poor, and the "abomination." [[Ezekiel 16.49–50|Ezekiel 16:49–50]], [[Isaiah 1.10–17|Isaiah 1:10–17]], [[Jude 1.7|Jude 1:7]]. God's justice is near-total, sparing only Lot and his family, until Lot's wife disobeys the command not to look back, and she is turned into a pillar of salt.  Lot and his daughters find refuge in the nearby town of Zoar.

Even in this story of severe consequences, God offers several chances to repent.  But ultimately, the consequence remains.  Earlier people living in a world far more dangerous and uncertain than the one many of us inhabit may have perceived God’s actions differently. It is also possible that divine revelation is expressed within cultural contexts appropriate for its audience, and that the intended recipients of the Old and New Testaments were not the same.

Reading ancient, moralizing literature is rarely easy.  Take, for instance, the story of creation.  It is possible to read the six days of work as literal days.  Some people do.  Others, myself included, see them more figuratively. Man counts days; does an all-powerful God, who exists outside of time and space, do the same, or in the same way? Not necessarily. Thinking of the “days” of creation as ages, epochs, or simply periods seems reasonable.

I can see a similar possibility here.  That unrepentant, grave sin can sever our relationship with God, but not because God abandons us, but because we turn away. Even in the preceding passage, God appears to “negotiate” with Abraham over Sodom’s fate, reducing the number of righteous people needed to spare the city  [[Genesis 18.16-33|Genesis 18:16-33]].  As a child, this but was confusing to me, because it felt to me like Abraham was trying to trick God into something.  But rereading it now, I see God taking every possible step to save humanity, while still honoring human freedom and will. God wants to, and will, save us; if we do our part. He will not force us.

**A small after-note**.  The section explaining why Zoar is called that is not immediately clear to many English readers (myself included). But learning that the name means “small” or “insignificant,” I’m reminded of a pattern seen across ancient literature. In many cultures’ wisdom traditions (especially those telling stories about places) you often find little etymological asides explaining how names came to be. This is incredibly common in the Iron Age Irish tales that survive (_see_ the Dindshenchas). The main thrust of these stories is to recount how towns and counties of Ireland got their names, usually accompanied by some moral lesson. It’s interesting to see that same trend reflected in the Old Testament as well.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
-  It's too easy to see the 'wages of sin' as punishment.  Instead, it's best to think of them relationally.  Sin is that which takes us further from God.  The "punishment" attached is simply the natural consequence of injuring that relationship.  If we find ourselves in the spot like the people of the plains were, in grave sin, we know where that road leads.  Instead, we must stop, reevaluate, and repair the relationship.  Thankfully, we have the tools at hand for the task: Reconciliation and the Eucharist.

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer:**  
-  Lord, thank you for your unending forgiveness.  Remind us that when we damage our relationship to You and to others, we are called to repair those relationships.  We say in the prayer that your Son taught us "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." Let us remember, then to forgive as often as we ask for forgiveness.  In Your name, we pray.

## 4. *Contemplatio* – Contemplation  
_Rest in God's presence._  

**Time in silence:**  

---
## Extra: *Actio* – Action  
_Discern a step to live out the passage._  
**What action am I being called to take today?**

-  I am working on forgiving someone who wronged me many years ago.  This weekend, I am planning on making a formal effort to bury that hatchet, set my anger aside, and forgive.
