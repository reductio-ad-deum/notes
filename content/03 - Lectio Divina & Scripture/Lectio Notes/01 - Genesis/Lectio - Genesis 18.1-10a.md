# Lectio Divina – Genesis 18:1-10a

---
## 1. *Lectio* – Reading  
_Read the passage slowly and attentively._  

**First Reading Notes (NABRE):**  
-  Abraham's visit by the angels.
- What's a terebinth?
	- A kind of cashew tree, it turns out.
	- Reminds me of the children's book Bridge to Terabithia.
	- Fresh bread, cheese and milk, good beef, washing water.  Abraham goes all out for the three angels.
	- Prophesied a son for a Sarah.

**Second Reading Notes (NJB):**  
-  Interesting.  It's an oak in the NJB.
	- Hebrew seems a bit vague on its vocabulary for "big trees."  Interesting that older translations use "plains" here and skip the plant taxonomy problem, altogether.

**Words or phrases that stood out:**  
-  "and he waited on them under the tree while they ate."

**Observations about the text:**  
It's interesting how often God appears in and/or around trees, shrubs, bushes, etc. in the Old Testament.  This passages starts off with saying the Lord appeared to Abraham, but the feature is  the three angels.  This is an interesting sort of conflict.

I can see it as the Lord appears by virtue of his messengers, or maybe a hint at early trinitarianism as seeing One Godhead in three persons.  It looks like both singular and plural forms are used in the Hebrew, but I have basically no understanding of Hebrew (I can struggle through Latin and Greek).  

These sorts of manifestations of the image of God near trees is interesting, though.  It has me thinking about idols versus natural presence.  One of the problems with idols is that they are man-made, then treated as if God/s were present there.  In the burning bush, or near the trees of Mamre, we have something God has made heralding his presence.  Falling down in adoration before the burning bush or this theophany with the angels are both taken in this natural context.

There is a similar parallel in the Eucharist, as displayed in a monstrance.  I can see there being a sort of prototypically (modern) Protestant objection to "worshiping" bread, but in fact what's being worshiped is the real presence of Christ with merely the accidents (appearance) of bread.  Someone without the proper theological understanding of what's happening there might see something they would identify as idolatry.  They would be wrong, however.

## 2. *Meditatio* – Meditation  
_Reflect deeply on the meaning._  

**Personal reflections and connections:**  
-  Abraham immediately knows he's in the presence of the Lord, and responds appropriately.  I wonder what he thought his day would hold, when the presence of God demanded a change in his plans?  He sees and understands, and then immediately sets about to work on praising and offering up what he has.  What a great example.

## 3. *Oratio* – Prayer  
_Respond to God in prayer._  

**Prayer:**  
-  Lord, give us the grace to recognize your presence in our lives the way that Abraham did your angels'.  Allow us to reorient, and pivot to that imminent necessity, and spare no spiritual expense to welcome you and praise you.  Amen.

## 4. *Contemplatio* – Contemplation  
_Rest in God's presence._  

**Time in silence:**
