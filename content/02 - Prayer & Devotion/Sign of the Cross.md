# Sign of the Cross
----
The **Sign of the Cross** is both a **gesture** and a **prayer**, marking the beginning and end of many Catholic prayers and devotions.

---
### **How to Make It**
Using your right hand:
1. Touch your forehead and say:  
    **“In the name of the Father”**
2. Touch your breast (center of your chest) and say:  
    **“and of the Son”**
3. Touch your left shoulder and then your right shoulder, saying:  
    **“and of the Holy Spirit.”**
4. Join your hands (or place them together on your chest) and say:  
    **“Amen.”**

---
### **What It Means**
- It **professes your faith** in the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- It **reminds you of Christ’s sacrifice** on the Cross.
- It **blesses yourself** by invoking God’s protection and grace.

### **In Latin**
In nómine Pátris,  
et Fílii,  
et Spíritus Sáncti.  
Amen.

### Notes:
- Eastern traditions may touch the right shoulder first.
- Eastern traditions use a special hand posture of three-fingers, which is a symbol I appreciate and often replicate.
