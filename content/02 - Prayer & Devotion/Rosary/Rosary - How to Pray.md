# Rosary - How to Pray
----
**1. Make the [[Sign of the Cross]].**
- Hold the crucifix and bless yourself:  
    _In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen._

**2. Pray the [[Apostles' Creed]].**
- Still holding the crucifix, recite this profession of faith.

**3. Pray one [[Our Father]].**
- On the first large bead after the crucifix.

**4. Pray three [[Hail Mary]]s.**
- On the next three small beads, for an increase in faith, hope, and charity.

**5. Pray one [[Glory Be]].**
- After the three Hail Marys.
_(Some people also add the [[Fatima Prayer]] here: “O my Jesus, forgive us our sins…”—this is optional.)_

**6. Announce the First Mystery.**
- For example: _The Annunciation_ (if you’re praying the Joyful Mysteries).
- Then say one [[Our Father]] on the next large bead.

**7. Pray ten [[Hail Mary]]s.**
- One on each of the ten small beads (a decade), while meditating on the Mystery.

**8. Pray one [[Glory Be]].**
- At the end of the decade.

**9. (Optional) Pray the Fatima Prayer:**
- _O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell…_

**10. Announce the Second Mystery**
- Then say one [[Our Father]], ten [[Hail Mary]]s, one [[Glory Be]], (Fatima Prayer).
- Repeat this same pattern for the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Mysteries.

**11. After completing all five decades:**
- Pray the [[Salve Regina|Hail Holy Queen]].

**12. Conclude with the closing prayer:**
- _O God, whose only begotten Son…_ (the Rosary Closing Prayer).
- Then finish with the [[Sign of the Cross]].
