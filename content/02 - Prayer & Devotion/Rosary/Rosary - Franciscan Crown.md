# Rosary - Franciscan Crown
----
**What It Is:**  
A special rosary with **seven decades** (instead of five), used by Franciscans to meditate on **Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary**.

**Origin:**  
According to tradition, a young friar who used to bring fresh flowers to a statue of Our Lady was sad he could no longer do so. The Virgin Mary appeared to him and asked him instead to offer a “crown” of prayers, recalling her joys.

### **Structure**
- **7 decades of 1 [[Our Father]] and 10 [[Hail Mary|Hail Marys]]** each
- **2 extra Hail Marys** added at the end (to make 72 in total, honoring Mary’s traditional age at the Assumption)

---
### **The Seven Joys**
Each decade commemorates one of these joys:
1. **The Annunciation** — The Angel Gabriel announces Christ’s coming.
2. **The Visitation** — Mary visits Elizabeth.
3. **The Nativity** — Birth of Jesus at Bethlehem.
4. **The Adoration of the Magi** — The Wise Men honor the newborn King.
5. **The Finding in the Temple** — Jesus is found teaching in the Temple.
6. **The Resurrection** — Jesus rises from the dead.
7. **The Assumption and Coronation** — Mary is taken into Heaven and crowned.

### **How to Pray It**
1. **Begin** with the [[Sign of the Cross]].
2. **Announce the first Joy.**
3. **Pray 1 Our Father and 10 Hail Marys.**
4. **Announce the next Joy**, repeating 1 Our Father and 10 Hail Marys for each.
5. After the 7th Joy, **pray 2 additional Hail Marys** in honor of the 72 years of Mary’s earthly life (some traditions may do it slightly differently).
6. **Finish** with the Gloria Patri (“[[Glory Be]]”) and any customary Marian prayers (like the [[Salve Regina]]).
7. **Conclude** with the Sign of the Cross.
