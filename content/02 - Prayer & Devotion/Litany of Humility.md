# Litany of Humility
----
O Jesus, meek and humble of heart,
**Hear me.**

From the desire of being esteemed,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being loved,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being extolled,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being honored,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being praised,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being preferred to others,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being consulted,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the desire of being approved,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being humiliated,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being despised,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of suffering rebukes,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being calumniated,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being forgotten,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being ridiculed,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being wronged,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

From the fear of being suspected,
**Deliver me, O Jesus.**

That others may be loved more than I,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That others may be esteemed more than I,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That, in the opinion of the world, others may increase and I may decrease,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That others may be chosen and I set aside,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That others may be praised and I go unnoticed,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That others may be preferred to me in everything,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

That others may become holier than I, provided that I may become as holy as I should,
**Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.**

**Charity**

Charity is patient, is kind; charity does not envy, is not pretentious, is not puffed up, is not ambitious, is not self-seeking, is not provoked; thinks no evil, does not rejoice over wickedness, but rejoices with the truth, bears with all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. (1 Cor. 13:4-7).

To have Charity is to love God above all things for Himself and be ready to renounce all created things rather than offend Him by serious sin. ( Matt. 22:36-40)
