# Chaplet of Divine Mercy
----
1. **Begin with the [[Sign of the Cross]]:**
    
    > In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
    
2. **Optional Opening Prayers:**
    
    > You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world.  
    > O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.  
    > _(Repeat 3 times)_  
    > O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You!
    
3. **[[Our Father]]:**
    
    > Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name;  
    > Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  
    > Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us;  
    > and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
    
4. **[[Hail Mary]]:**
    
    > Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;  
    > blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
    > Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
    
5. **The [[Apostles’ Creed]]:**
    
    > I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;  
    > and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;  
    > who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,  
    > suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried;  
    > He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead;  
    > He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;  
    > from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.  
    > I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints,  
    > the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

## **The Decades (On the Rosary Beads)**

**On each “Our Father” bead before each decade:**

> Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,  
> in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.

**On each of the ten “Hail Mary” beads of the decade:**

> For the sake of His sorrowful Passion,  
> have mercy on us and on the whole world.

_(Repeat this pattern for all 5 decades.)_
