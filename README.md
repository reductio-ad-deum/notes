# 📖 Hypomnemata: 

> “The writing of hypomnēmata was thus a way of training oneself to live in the present, of keeping at hand the essential truths which could transform existence.” — Pierre Hadot

This is a digital notebook created using Obsidian.md and Quartz focused on personal and spiritual development.  The title, Reductio ad Deum, signifies a return to God, a reorientating and reorienting to that core principle.  I am a long-time student of philosophy, who rather unexpctedly found myself with a call to "face up" and return to God.  I am working through this process and journey in real-time, and with the door open.
