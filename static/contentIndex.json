Lectio – Reading\nRead the passage slowly and attentively.\nFirst Reading Notes (NABRE):\n\nAbraham’s visit by the angels.\nWhat’s a terebinth?\n\nA kind of cashew tree, it turns out.\nReminds me of the children’s book Bridge to Terabithia.\nFresh bread, cheese and milk, good beef, washing water.  Abraham goes all out for the three angels.\nProphesied a son for a Sarah.\n\n\n\nSecond Reading Notes (NJB):\n\nInteresting.  It’s an oak in the NJB.\n\nHebrew seems a bit vague on its vocabulary for “big trees.”  Interesting that older translations use “plains” here and skip the plant taxonomy problem, altogether.\n\n\n\nWords or phrases that stood out:\n\n“and he waited on them under the tree while they ate.”\n\nObservations about the text:\nIt’s interesting how often God appears in and/or around trees, shrubs, bushes, etc. in the Old Testament.  This passages starts off with saying the Lord appeared to Abraham, but the feature is  the three angels.  This is an interesting sort of conflict.\nI can see it as the Lord appears by virtue of his messengers, or maybe a hint at early trinitarianism as seeing One Godhead in three persons.  It looks like both singular and plural forms are used in the Hebrew, but I have basically no understanding of Hebrew (I can struggle through Latin and Greek).\nThese sorts of manifestations of the image of God near trees is interesting, though.  It has me thinking about idols versus natural presence.  One of the problems with idols is that they are man-made, then treated as if God/s were present there.  In the burning bush, or near the trees of Mamre, we have something God has made heralding his presence.  Falling down in adoration before the burning bush or this theophany with the angels are both taken in this natural context.\nThere is a similar parallel in the Eucharist, as displayed in a monstrance.  I can see there being a sort of prototypically (modern) Protestant objection to “worshiping” bread, but in fact what’s being worshiped is the real presence of Christ with merely the accidents (appearance) of bread.  Someone without the proper theological understanding of what’s happening there might see something they would identify as idolatry.  They would be wrong, however.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nAbraham immediately knows he’s in the presence of the Lord, and responds appropriately.  I wonder what he thought his day would hold, when the presence of God demanded a change in his plans?  He sees and understands, and then immediately sets about to work on praising and offering up what he has.  What a great example.\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nPrayer:\n\nLord, give us the grace to recognize your presence in our lives the way that Abraham did your angels’.  Allow us to reorient, and pivot to that imminent necessity, and spare no spiritual expense to welcome you and praise you.  Amen.\n\n\n4.

Lectio – Reading\nRead the passage slowly and attentively.\nFirst Reading Notes (NABRE):\n\nThat is why the town is called Zoar. Why is that?\n\nZoar/Segor apparently means “small” or “insignificant.”\n\n\nBut Lot’s wife looked back, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.\n\nLuke 17:32\n\n\n\nSecond Reading Notes (NJB):\n\nThus it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he did not forget Abraham and he rescued Lot from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities where Lot was living.\n\nWords or phrases that stood out:\n\npillar of salt\ndid not forget\nrescued\n\nObservations about the text:\nOne of the difficulties many modern readers—including myself—have is reconciling the God of the New Testament, characterized by love, forgiveness, and mercy, with the God of the Old Testament, who often appears as an agent of vengeance, punishment, and destruction. Genesis 19 is a stark example: it records both the destruction of the cities of the plain and the fate of Lot’s wife.\nIn this chapter, Sodom and Gomorrah are guilty of grave sins: pride, greed, injustice, neglect of the poor, and the “abomination.” Ezekiel 16:49–50, Isaiah 1:10–17, Jude 1:7. God’s justice is near-total, sparing only Lot and his family, until Lot’s wife disobeys the command not to look back, and she is turned into a pillar of salt.  Lot and his daughters find refuge in the nearby town of Zoar.\nEven in this story of severe consequences, God offers several chances to repent.  But ultimately, the consequence remains.  Earlier people living in a world far more dangerous and uncertain than the one many of us inhabit may have perceived God’s actions differently. It is also possible that divine revelation is expressed within cultural contexts appropriate for its audience, and that the intended recipients of the Old and New Testaments were not the same.\nReading ancient, moralizing literature is rarely easy.  Take, for instance, the story of creation.  It is possible to read the six days of work as literal days.  Some people do.  Others, myself included, see them more figuratively. Man counts days; does an all-powerful God, who exists outside of time and space, do the same, or in the same way? Not necessarily. Thinking of the “days” of creation as ages, epochs, or simply periods seems reasonable.\nI can see a similar possibility here.  That unrepentant, grave sin can sever our relationship with God, but not because God abandons us, but because we turn away. Even in the preceding passage, God appears to “negotiate” with Abraham over Sodom’s fate, reducing the number of righteous people needed to spare the city  Genesis 18:16-33.  As a child, this but was confusing to me, because it felt to me like Abraham was trying to trick God into something.  But rereading it now, I see God taking every possible step to save humanity, while still honoring human freedom and will. God wants to, and will, save us; if we do our part. He will not force us.\nA small after-note.  The section explaining why Zoar is called that is not immediately clear to many English readers (myself included). But learning that the name means “small” or “insignificant,” I’m reminded of a pattern seen across ancient literature. In many cultures’ wisdom traditions (especially those telling stories about places) you often find little etymological asides explaining how names came to be. This is incredibly common in the Iron Age Irish tales that survive (see the Dindshenchas). The main thrust of these stories is to recount how towns and counties of Ireland got their names, usually accompanied by some moral lesson. It’s interesting to see that same trend reflected in the Old Testament as well.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nIt’s too easy to see the ‘wages of sin’ as punishment.  Instead, it’s best to think of them relationally.  Sin is that which takes us further from God.  The “punishment” attached is simply the natural consequence of injuring that relationship.  If we find ourselves in the spot like the people of the plains were, in grave sin, we know where that road leads.  Instead, we must stop, reevaluate, and repair the relationship.  Thankfully, we have the tools at hand for the task: Reconciliation and the Eucharist.\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nPrayer:\n\nLord, thank you for your unending forgiveness.  Remind us that when we damage our relationship to You and to others, we are called to repair those relationships.  We say in the prayer that your Son taught us “and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Let us remember, then to forgive as often as we ask for forgiveness.  In Your name, we pray.\n\n\n4. Contemplatio – Contemplation\nRest in God’s presence.\nTime in silence:\n\nExtra: Actio – Action\nDiscern a step to live out the passage.\nWhat action am I being called to take today?\n\nI am working on forgiving someone who wronged me many years ago.  This weekend, I am planning on making a formal effort to bury that hatchet, set my anger aside, and forgive.\n\n"},"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/47---Matthew/Lectio---Matthew-16.13-19":{"slug":"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/47---Matthew/Lectio---Matthew-16.13-19","filePath":"03 - Lectio Divina & Scripture/Lectio Notes/47 - Matthew/Lectio - Matthew 16.13-19.md","title":"Lectio - Matthew 16.13-19","links":["Daniel-7.13","John-1.42","Isaiah-22.22","Matthew-18.18","John-20.23"],"tags":["lectio-divina","matthew"],"content":"Lectio Divina – Matthew 16:13-19\n\n1.

Kepha (כֵּיפָא), meaning rock, is the same for the name and substance/item.  Interesting.  Also, maintained in John 1.42 “You shall be called Cephas.”  Cursory reading suggests it was not a given name prior to this early Christina use.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations about the text (literal meaning, characters, structure, etc.):\nReceiving the Keys of the Kingdom is such a powerful image.  In re-reading these passages after a long time away, the preparation Jesus undertakes to organize and bolster his students is much more apparent to me, now.\nThe Papacy is one of the most difficult parts of Catholicism for other Christians.  The objections range from reasonable (primus inter pares) to bigoted.  Modernly, we give “the key to the city” to some favored resident or VIP, and while that is poignant presentation, it lacks the import of the Keys of the Kingdom.\nIn doing some side-reading, I was directed back to the Old Testament.  “I will place the key of the House of David on his shoulder; what he opens, no one will shut, what he shuts, no one will open.” Isaiah 22.22 In Isaiah, Eliakim is given the “key of the house of David,” and what he opens will be open, and closes will be closed.  The parallel between that text and the present is clear.  Here, The Son of David gives the Keys of the Kingdom, and orders that what Simon-Peter binds and looses on earth will be held as such in heaven.\nThis given strictly to Peter.  I see some arguments that the Commissioning was for all of the Apostles at this time, but the text has Jesus saying “thee” or singular-you in the Greek (σοι).  So that reading seems unlikely. This, coupled with the rock-bit do seem to be giving Peter a unique, singular position.  There are other, seemingly related passages that do expand a similar authority to the other Disciples (Matthew 18.18), and institute the forgiveness of sins (John 20.23), but it’s not clear that this is the exact same as what’s laid on Peter, here.\nIt’s interesting to see the divine authority of Jesus being invested in the earthly foundation he is laying.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nIt is a great comfort to know that one’s soul is in the same state of grace after Confession as at the moment of one’s Baptism.  That grace, however, is checked by the awareness that need for it lies squarely on us.  Our tendency and actions/omissions which injure our relationship to God are our responsibility.  One must be extremely vigilant to avoid the “oh well, I’ll just go to Confession,” slippery slope when addressing the sin in our hearts.\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nPrayer (thanksgiving, intercession, sorrow, praise, etc.):\n\nLord, thank you for providing us with your Church in your absence.  We are grateful full to have the Keys to the Kingdom here on Earth, that open the pathway to your everlasting divine love and presence.  Thank you for knowing that we would need guideposts, guides, and directions in the journey back into your presence in the world to come.  Amen.\n\n\n4. Contemplatio – Contemplation\nRest in God’s presence.\nTime in silence:\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nLord, thank your for this time with your Word.

Lectio – Reading\nRead the passage slowly and attentively.\nWhat does the text say?\nFirst Reading Notes (NABRE):\n\nAh, the story of the Roman  Centurion, and the response to the Invitation to Communion.\nThis was probably my least favorite re-translation I’ve had to re-learn.\nI do like this story, and I remember it being challenging to me as a child.  This guy, a sort of paragon of the enemy, he has the most faith?  How can that be?\nBut it is in fact a beautiful faith.  And the Centurion is standing right on the line of risking everything to profess it, but stands to gain so much.\nHow scared he must’ve been that he would be turned away, told no, or shamed.\nBut as the message is over, and over, and over again: there is endless grace and forgiveness available.\nAll we need is a little bravery and a true heart.\n\nWords or phrases that stood out:\n\n“Lord, I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof; only say the word and my servant will be healed.” (NABRE)\n\nObservations about the text (literal meaning, characters, structure, etc.):\nThis line was one of the re-translations from the 2010 Missal that gave me the most fits.  “Why did they change the mass?!” I mentally would rage. (Old Man yells at cloud meme, here.)  The line I grew up with, and had memorized is: “Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word, and I shall be healed.”  Surely, that’s the proper way, “to have you enter under my roof” sounds weird.  I hated it.\nAs a child, you learn the Mass by exposure, copying those around you.  It’s rote.  Performative. Or at least it was to me. As an adult, coming back into the Church after many years away, and learning a new Missal more than a decade after it came out, I had to ask: “did they really change the mass?” and “If so, why?”\nIn short, the answer is ‘no.’  And the why makes some sense after some digging.\nWhat is the Mass, is the first question to ask, then.  Is the Mass its official English translation or the translation I prefer?  Also, no.  The language of the Catholic Church in the west is Latin.  So, what’s the Latin say?  The Latin in both the 1962 Missal and the 1970 Missal is: “Dómine, non sum dignus, ut intres sub tectum meum: sed tantum dic verbo, et sanábitur ánima mea.”\nMy Latin is a little rusty, but it does exist.  “[U]t intres sub tectum meum,” is fairly clear: “that you should enter under my roof” would be my translation.  Intres is the second-person present subjunctive, so neither the 1970 or 2010 English translations capture the subjunctive mood (which sadly is falling out use in modern English). Grammatical moods aside, the 2010 translation is a better word-for-word translation, and does let the congregation know they are actually quoting scripture, rather than merely making a formal, ritual statement.  That was news to me. I never recognized this portion of the Mass as scripture.  I didn’t recognize it, because the translation I grew up with obfuscated it.\nI do appreciate still, however, the flexibility of “to receive you” as that can cover receiving an honored visitor in one’s house, as in the story of the Roman  Centurion, or we poor sinners about to receive the Holy Eucharist into our bodies.  That “feels more right” than wrangling with what part of my mouth/head is the roof.  It’s a more flexible, and dare-I-say-it, useful translation.  But there is artistic license in it, that prioritizes spiritual accessibility over literal precision.\nEvery translation is a synthesis between the author and the translator.  No translator “perfectly” captures all of the surface level meaning, the subtext, the context, and the cultural climate of the author compared to the cultural climate of the reader.  Translation is serious business, and it is hard.  Choices have to be made.\nThe trend in the 2010 Missal, I now know, is towards a more faithful, word-for-word translation of the Latin Rite Mass.1  That’s the why.\nSo did they change the Mass?  No, not really.  But if they did, they only changed it back.\nSecond Reading Notes (NJB):\n\n Jesus said, ‘Go back, then; let this be done for you, as your faith demands.’\n\nSlightly awkward turn of phrase there.  I wonder what that is in the Greek.\n\nὡς ἐπίστευσας γενηθήτω σοι.\nSomething like “as you believed, let it be done to you.”\nσοι is dative, so “to” not “for,” but “for” sounds more natural in English.  The NABRE translation (unsurprisingly) is more literal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nWhat is God saying to me through this passage?\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nI’m think back on my note above, that the Centurion must’ve been afraid that he would be turned away, or shamed.  I’m reminded of the fear or uncomfortableness that we can experience before the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  If you have ever had the concern that you would be denied absolution, then you absolutely know the tension I’m talking about.  Yet the Centurion goes anyway, heart in hand.  We, too, can approach God through both the Eucharist and Confession, heart in hand, with a little bit of bravery and whatever faith we can muster.  It was enough for the Centurion, and in God’s mercy, it can be enough for us too.\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nWhat do I want to say to God?\nPrayer (thanksgiving, intercession, sorrow, praise, etc.):\n\nLord, as you met the great faith of the Roman Centurion and delivered to him what he needed, may you also meet us where we are, and through your divine mercy deliver to us what we need.  The faith of the Centurion, through your power, resulted in your healing of his servant. Help a like faith grow in our hearts.  Plant its seeds, that it may bear the fruits of your will in ourselves and in others.  Amen.\n\n\n4. Contemplatio – Contemplation\nRest in God’s presence.\nHow is God inviting me to simply be with Him?\nTime in silence:\nWhat did I experience or notice in the stillness?\n\nI had a difficult time focusing today, I’m a little under-slept.  I called my attention back to the stillness with my breath, and waited.  Meeting us where we are at might also be meeting us when we are tired, unfocused, and struggling.  Let us become comfortable in that tension, and rest in the faith that there is grace even there.\n\n\nExtra: Actio – Action\nDiscern a step to live out the passage.\nWhat action am I being called to take today?\n\nI will look for opportunities to bring my faith to God, and trust that what I need will be delivered.\n\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nLord, thank your for this time with your Word.  Allow understanding to enter our minds and hearts, and change those minds and hearts that we may better emulate your Son, Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n\n\nFootnotes:\nFootnotes\n\n\nLiturgiam Authenticam (2001) shifted the Church’s official translation philosophy back toward formal equivalence. ↩\n\n\n"},"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/49---Luke/Lectio---Luke-10.1-12,-17-20":{"slug":"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/49---Luke/Lectio---Luke-10.1-12,-17-20","filePath":"03 - Lectio Divina & Scripture/Lectio Notes/49 - Luke/Lectio - Luke 10.1-12, 17-20.md","title":"Lectio - Luke 10.1-12, 17-20","links":["03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lection-Divina-TOC"],"tags":[],"content":"Lectio Divina – Luke 10:1-12, 17-20\n\n1. Lectio – Reading\nRead the passage slowly and attentively.\nWhat does the text say?\nFirst Reading Notes (NABRE):\n\nI’ve always found the visual of shaking the dust from one’s sandals a compelling one.\n\nBut interestingly, “no sandals” is one of the instructions, so either I misremember this reference or it has been absorbed incorrectly into the popular parlance.\n\n\nThe reference to Sodom, and presumably God’s justice is interesting.\nI recall reading somewhere that the instructions to take no pack or belongings may have been to avoid the appearance of Cynic philosophers.  Which is interesting, since the Cynico-Stoic stamp of philosophy as a way of life certainly was impressed upon early Christians.\n\nSecond Reading Notes (Greek):\n\nChrist’s admonition to avoid pride when the power of God works through these one’s sent out is worth dwelling on.\nDo these Seventy-Two (Seventy?) have titles, like Apostles or Disciples?\n\nIn the Greek they’re just described as ἑτέρους (others), and they are “sent out” (ἀπέστειλεν), but not called Apostles like the Twelve.\nThe Greek text has it written like ‘seventy[-two]’ which is weird.  Apparently there are some differences in early manuscripts?\n\n\n“Man of peace” is υἱὸς εἰρήνης, literally ‘a son of peace,’ which is poetic.\n\nWords or phrases that stood out:\n\nRejoice (line 20)\n\nχαίρω (rejoice) is etymologically related to χάρις (grace), which is interesting.\n\n\nSerpents and scorpions (line 19)\n\n ὄφεων καὶ σκορπίων, just what it says.\n\nLike English, ὄφις can be used figuratively as a sly, cunning, or malicious person.\n\n\n\n\nSpirits (line 20)\n\nπνεύματα is an interesting word here.  πνεῦμα doesn’t have any negative connotation for me, I would think it’s actually neutral or even positive in the Greco-Roman sense of ‘spirit.’  But it immediately follows the line about treading on serpents and scorpions, so I tend to read it negatively, more like the English word demon.  In the NABRE, ‘tread upon serpents’ is set off like this, with single quotes.  Not sure why.  Is that a quote from the Old Testament?\n\n\n\nObservations about the text (literal meaning, characters, structure, etc.):\nHere, the instruction to take no bag, sandals, or provisions is an interesting one.  The Cynics were well known for several things, including the philosopher’s cloak, a staff, and bag.  These were outward symbols of radical independence, simple living, and pursing virtue instead of worldly comforts.\nI tend to agree with Clement of Alexandria, that the paving of the way by Hellenistic philosophy is integral to the spread of early Christianity.  It certainly seems that way, at least in retrospect.\nOne can see how Jesus’ early followers might be mistaken for itinerant philosophers, but the missions of the Twelve and the Seventy-Two are distinct from these.  It is worth noting, though, that the Greco-Roman context of ancient philosophy certain would have touched the Levant, and early Christians were not the first to market in these kinds of ideas.\nIt would have been important to distinguish early Christians from Cynics, not because of their radical virtue ethics, simple living, or the fact that they engaged in public teaching; but rather because the message of salvation in God is very different than the call to goodness through virtue.  Cynics like Diogenes engaged in public teaching by action, sometimes by lewd or shocking behaviors.  Diogenes message to the Greeks was to set aside the cultural hang-ups of everyday life for the promise of virtue and wisdom.\nWhile the call of Christianity is not alien to this (broadly), it is a higher sort of claim.  It is not a mere exercise of our rational faculties and spirit, but an answer to the call to join with God in the way He desires and the way for which we are created.  It is not just about “the good life” of philosophical practice, but the call to eternal life in the presence of God.\nThe magnitude of the mission, therefore, is so much greater.\nThe philosopher’s call to simple living is about learning to view the world for what it is.  To be able to judge what only appears to be good or evil from what is actually god or evil.  It is training, ἄσκησις.  But the command from Christ here to the Seventy-Two is less about their training, and more about their reliance on God.  The difference is stark.\nThe ascetic training of the philosopher is self-focused end, and the radical reliance Christ commands is God-focused.  They are basically incomparable: the telos is different, union with God, not just cultivation of virtue.\nChrist’s interactions with the Hellenistic word is similar, in some regards, to his interactions with the Jewish world.  He comes in a context steeped in those environments.  He sees that which is ordered to God’s plan in both, and that which is disordered.  He sees this, communicates it to us, and calls us to follow in the corrected path.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nWhat is God saying to me through this passage?\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\n\nMy own journey lately mirrors the historical procession of ancient philosophy to Christ’s revelation.  It is an issue I’ve been wrestling with for some time.  I have this large body of work, years of effort, study, and public apologetics out there.  Do I mention this serious μετάνοια which has occurred in my own life to them?  Or leave the work as it is, as a testament to the progress I made which has in part brought me here?  I don’t know what the right answer is.\n\n\nMy experience is not quite so severe as St. Paul’s (whose Solemnity we just celebrated this past week), but it’s not so dissimilar, either.  Paul was a Pharisee, I was a philosopher.  Paul experienced a terrifying vision, I experienced a terrifying-to-me-yet-wonderful miracle.  Both produced an immediate inner change: a  conversion in his case, and a reversion in mine.  Both of us probably ended up in places we would not have ever imagined.  The skills that lead Paul to be a learned Pharisee are the skills he brought to his new life in Christ.  He authored a large portion of the New Testament.  Similarly for me, the academic, linguistic, and ascetic skills I learned studying philosophy as a way of life may be able to find new use here, as I rediscover Christianity and its place in my life.\n\n\nThis has actually been something I’ve been avoiding, because I’m not sure how these two phases of my life can fit together.  This lectio divina project is the first scratch against the surface for using my experiencing studying philosophy, but I think I am starting to see that in fact many of the tools I became familiar with are suitable for this new (to me) craft as well.\n\n\nI have been worried that I might be ridiculed by others, that the perceived value of my past work would be lessened.  Maybe even that I betrayed some precept or focus that I used to have. What will my philosophy colleagues think to learn that I’ve suddenly been shunted down this very different path?  Will they think less of me?  Does that actually matter?\n\n\nI have perhaps been too focused on the provisions I need on my sending forth.  Looking for another resource, another companion, worried to set out and just start.  But the command from Christ is not to (overly?)prepare for the journey, but to go!\n\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nWhat do I want to say to God?\nPrayer (thanksgiving, intercession, sorrow, praise, etc.):\n\nLord, your plans are beyond out comprehension.  Your time is not our time.  As the chapters of our lives progress, give us the grace to see the threads of the story your are weaving.  Let us rely, radically, on that which you provide in the times and places you ordain.  Provision us with  faith in you, when the world seems hostile and full of serpents and scorpions.  Send us the sons of peace, to provide for us what you desire.  And let us rest happy and content in your mission, because it is your will, and yours alone.  Amen.\n\n\n4. Contemplatio – Contemplation\nRest in God’s presence.\nHow is God inviting me to simply be with Him?\nTime in silence :\nWhat did I experience or notice in the stillness?\n\nI had thoughts of Eucharistic adoration, of viewing the monstrance, and of praying while prostrate.\n\n\nExtra: Actio – Action\nDiscern a step to live out the passage.\nWhat action am I being called to take today?\n\nI should take some time to review my philosophical work and practice, and see which of those tools are prepared for the new work ahead of me.\nI should schedule some time to sit in Adoration, maybe to pray but also to have that time and space for reading and study.\n\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nLord, thank your for this time with your Word.  Allow understanding to enter our minds and hearts, and change those minds and hearts that we may better emulate your Son, Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n"},"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/49---Luke/Lectio---Luke-10.25-37":{"slug":"03---Lectio-Divina--and--Scripture/Lectio-Notes/49---Luke/Lectio---Luke-10.25-37","filePath":"03 - Lectio Divina & Scripture/Lectio Notes/49 - Luke/Lectio - Luke 10.25-37.md","title":"Lectio - Luke 10.25-37","links":["John-4","Numbers-19.11-13","02---Prayer--and--Devotion/Personal-Prayers/Lectio-Prayer"],"tags":["lectio-divina","gospel","luke","good-samaritan"],"content":"Lectio Divina – Luke 10:25-37\n\n1.

But they’re clearly two different types of people.  Will need to look into this.\n\nSecond Reading Notes (Greek):\n\nWords in question:\n\nἱερεύς /hiereus/ - one who preforms sacrificial rites.\nΛευίτης /levitis/ - a Levite.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAh, okay.  All priests were Levites in Second Temple Judaism, but not all Levites are priests (descended from Aaron).  So here, we have a line of people, each a little less fancy/respectable than the last, ending with the Samaritans weren’t well thought of.\nBoth of these first two would have religious obligations here, and would be held to a high standard, and neither does.  Each would have been understood to know and live the law. Only the more detestable one treats the injured man as his neighbor, and thus follows the law as its intended.\nPossibly a subtext of legalism versus having the law written on one’s heart?\n\nNorthern Tribe v. Southern Tribe beef continues.  John 4.\nIs there some question or concern with ritual purity, if they thought the man was a corpse?  Numbers 19.11-13.\n\n\n\n\n\nWords or phrases that stood out:\n\nMercy (NABRE) and Pity (NJB)\n\nἔλεος - pity, mercy, compassion; benefit which results from compassion, kindness, mercies, blessing.\nPity seems to me to have a slightly negative connotation that mercy lacks.  But clearly we’re working with the same Greek word, here.  That probably says more about me than it does the text.\n\n\n\nObservations about the text:\nIt’s interesting as someone not from this culture and time how the people of Samaria are often held up as paragons of all that’s wrong for the Jews of the Second Temple.  Ethnically and religiously, to me, they are clearly related.  However each views the other as corrupted or schismatic, misinterpreting what’s important.\nIt’s interesting that Christ uses this bias like a mirror for his audience, showing them to themselves by casting those they detest in the more favorable light.  This could be an interesting sort of spiritual exercise.\nWhat people do I detest?  Who do I think badly about without cause?  Can I imagine them as loving family members?  Those who hold doors for the elderly or pregnant?  Do they like dogs, and do the dogs like them back?\nThis is sort of the inverse of a philosophical exercise Marcus Aurelius describes in Book X.19 of Meditations:\n\nWhat creatures they are; they eat, sleep, copulate, relieve nature, and so on; then what are they like as rulers, imperious or angry and fault-finding to excess; yet but yesterday how many masters were they slaving for and to what purpose, and to-morrow they will be in a like condition.\n\nMarcus is trying to break his tendency towards enchantment with the world.  He is trying to refocus himself from the trappings of importance, and note that we’re all just men doing our allotted tasks.  Set a side the purple, and get to work.\nHere, rather than imagining fancy people are their worst to avoid holding men in too high esteem, Christ invites us to imagine those we think less of at their best. Rather than shaking a preoccupation with what our neighbors have or do, Christ calls us to be a neighbor, to show mercy, and do what is right.  In this passage, the best of the good Samaritan is better still than the Sons of even Aaron.  That’s something.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nIn the West, and probably in all of modernity, the view of the people of Samaria is totally shaped by this passage.  The biases and sectarianism of the Second Temple era are gone.  For us here, the Samaritans are not religious schismatics worshiping on the wrong mountain, but instead the example of the good man we are called to be.  There’s a certain poetic justice to this.  I wonder if the student of the law had any inkling that his question would reshape the view of a whole people?  I think probably not.\n\nImages, thoughts, or memories stirred by the text:\n\nMy view of the story of the good Samaritan was not very nuanced growing up. I don’t (and didn’t) have any of the context or baggage associated with that people, so for me, the lesson didn’t quite land the same.  I did understand that juxtaposition of a priest ignoring one who needed help, and a foreigner stopping to offer help.  Not only that, but he goes above and beyond, ensuring that the man is cared for across a number of days, not just in the immediate.\nWho would Jesus cast as the Samaritan today to get passed my pride?\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nPrayer:\n\nLord, cleanse our hearts of the biases and bigotries of our peoples and our nations.  In their place, inculcate in us a love for those who need us the most.  Help us to set aside a fascination with the form of the law, and help us to live the spirit of the law as You taught us.

Interesting visual of the effects of anxiety, there.\n\n\n… and it is not to be taken from her.\n\nObservations about the text:\nThis was always an interesting story to me.  I sympathized with Martha, who is doing her best to be a good host.  She’s got a lot of pressure in hosting these guests.  We have similar cultural expectations today, but I’m guessing those were more pressing in her place and time.  At a cursory reading, Mary seems to be shirking a duty.  In fact, she’s attending a more serious duty.  Martha is caught up in the appearance of things, and Mary is attending to what’s actually urgent.\nI am a person who often is tied up in the logistics.  I like to plan, have things laid out, and a clear goals.  Are all the materials and tools at hand?  Have we talked through the steps a couple of times?  Have we discussed possible hiccoughs?  Okay, then we can begin.\nMy wife is very different.  She prepares what’s needed right now, and gets started.  She may have to circle around a few times, restart, get help, or otherwise make accommodations.  But she’s working.\nThe net effect of these different dynamics is she starts more things than I do.  I’m not sure that one is per force better than the other, both are at time advantageous, and other times disadvantageous.  We often have difficulty communicating about projects, because we think of them so differently.  It’s a weird outlier, actually.  Because in basically every other realm we communicate very well.\nI need to talk though each step to make sure we have a shared understanding.  She can work silent next to someone, and just fill in.  Intuiting the next steps.  Radically different processes.\nI see myself in Martha, here.  Concerned for the logistics.  Making sure all the people and things are in the right space.  Often beset by anxiety and stress.  I see my wife in Mary, attending to what’s important, intuiting what’s next, and doing the right thing.  This may be an oversimplification, in some instances these roles are reversed, of course.  But the important thing here is to note Jesus’ clarification on what the real work is, and how to do it.\n\n2.

Simon Peter and his compatriots need for fish seems like such a small thing to merit a miracle.  But don’t all of the trials, tribulations, difficulties, joys, and success of others often feel small?\nOf course God knows our burdens, and in his mercy meets us where we are.  Simon Peter needed not just a miracle, but this one.  It seems some small thing, that one catch should be underwhelming.  But it is precisely the right spot to place the lever to move his heart.\nWhen we experience God in those little moments, those too are a miracle.  And they may not seem so to others, but when they move our hearts they are surely something special.\n\n2. Meditatio – Meditation\nReflect deeply on the meaning.\nPersonal reflections and connections:\n\nWhat small things in my life are the fish of other people’s?\nDo I remain open to see the workings of God, or rely too much on what I think the opinions of others might be?\nWould I be embarrassed to tell my fish-story?  Was Simon Peter?\n\n\n3. Oratio – Prayer\nRespond to God in prayer.\nPrayer:\n\nLord, thank you in great goodness for knowing the small things that move our hearts.  Thank you for the miracle of your Son, and for the gifts of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  Prepare our hearts to perceive and receive those moments of your grace, and keep us ever vigilant for the effects of your love in our lives.\n\n\n4.
